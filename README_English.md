Project: Spatial Anchor System Refactor
The Goal
Moving beyond "just making it work" with SDKs to truly understanding the underlying logic. I’m rebuilding my Spatial Anchor system from the ground up to solidify my Unity and XR foundations.

Key Objectives

Scalable Architecture: Create a reusable framework for faster, more structured development in future projects.

Clean Code & Design: Apply SOLID principles and Design Patterns to decouple logic and improve maintainability.

SDK Mastery: Deep dive into the latest Meta XR SDK features.

Core Mission
To sharpen my development intuition and establish a professional, high-standard XR workflow.
