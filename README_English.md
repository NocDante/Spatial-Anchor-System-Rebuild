# Spatial Anchor System Rebuild

---

## 📌 Project Overview (English)

This project focuses on **rebuilding a Spatial Anchor system from a previous Unity project** as a learning exercise.

Instead of simply upgrading tools or following SDK examples, the goal is to **redesign the system with a clearer understanding of how things work**, while gradually adapting to newer Unity and Meta development workflows.

Meta-provided features are still used, but the emphasis is placed on:
- Understanding system behavior  
- Improving project structure  
- Writing clearer and more maintainable code

## 🎯 Project Goals (English)

- Rebuild a previously used Spatial Anchor system with a cleaner design  
- Reduce dependency on specific tools or example-driven code  
- Re-familiarize with Unity’s XR development workflow  
- Practice writing readable and maintainable code

## 🧠 Learning Focus (English)

- The role of Spatial Anchors in a Unity XR project  
- Anchor creation, saving, and loading flow  
- Basic system design principles in Unity projects  
- Moving from “working code” to “well-structured code”
